	First full day of working on this library project. Had the basic layout and colour scheme set up already yesterday, but I immediately had the idea to make the books have more pages on screen based on the actual pagecounts entered. This probably would've been pretty easy to do with an absolutely positioned image under the page cover, and having that image just slide further out based on the size of the book. I decided to instead use divs and css to generate trapezoids that progressively get smaller, creating a sense of perspective on the book. Even if it's a stupider way to implement this overall, I think it'll still end up being good practice.
	
	Kinda tired today. Should be able to sleep well tonight and make some good progress on this tomorrow. Was still able to implement a decent looking book layout with randomized cover art. Also implemented the skeleton for the add book input panel pretty quickly. Should be easy enough to add functionality, as most of the pieces are all there. I'll probably limit the scope of the fancy stuff I add to this from here on out, as I want to speed through some more of TOP and really invest time in the bigger projects. We'll see.

	New keyboard and mouse came in way earlier than expected, so that's nice. Unfortunately the hard part will be editing books apparently. Adding a new book was a relatively simple process, but editing existing content is proving to be a huge pain in the ass. Thought I might be done with this project by the end of the day, but not so sure if that'll be the case anymore. It'll eventually work though, and by the time it does I'm sure the trouble will be worth it.

	Wow, several hours later and still massively struggling, not sure what the issue is yet. Will have to take a break for now and come back tomorrow with a fresh set of eyes. I think I built this from the ground up in a way that would screw me over down the line. That or I don't understand objects yet. Probably the latter.
